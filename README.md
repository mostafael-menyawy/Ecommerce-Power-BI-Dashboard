# E-commerce Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
The E-commerce Sales Dashboard project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of online sales data, offering deep insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and marketing effectiveness. The goal is to empower stakeholders with actionable intelligence to optimize sales strategies, enhance customer engagement, and drive business growth. This dashboard features multiple interactive views for detailed exploration.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data ingestion, transformation, analysis, visualization, and interactive dashboard creation.

## Data Cleaning (Assumed Steps - customize if different)
The data preparation process involved several steps to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis:
- Handling Missing Values: Addressed missing data in critical fields by appropriate methods (e.g., imputation for numerical data if suitable, or flagging/removing records with incomplete essential information).
- Data Formatting: Ensured consistency in data types (e.g., dates converted to date format, monetary values to numeric, categorical data standardized).
- Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed any duplicate transaction or customer records to maintain data integrity.
- Outlier Review: Potentially reviewed significant outliers in sales figures or quantities for validation.
